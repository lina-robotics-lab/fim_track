'''
jax is a python package implemented by Google, for the ease of auto-differentiation.

jax wraps all the numpy functions to be ready for auto-differentiation, and package them in jax.numpy

Every function written using the jnp wrappers can be differentiated using the grad or jac function.

	'''
		The state space model for the target tracking system is the constant velocity model.

		It assumes the target always move in constant velocity, and that is good enough for 
		many location estimation tasks.
		
		The states are in the format of:
			x=[x1,x2,...,xn,x1',x2',...,xn']
		
		The system dynamics becomes:    
			
			x'=Ax, y=meas_func(x,p)
			
			We ignore the sampling time constant and simplify the update formula as
			
				x_i(t+1) = x_i(t) + x_i'(t) + d
				x_i'(t) = x_i'(t) + w
		
			so 	   A =[[I,I],
					   [O,I]]
				it has shape 4n x 4n, and each block matrix has shape 2n x 2n

				  
			and meas_func takes in a num_targets x 2 vector x, and a num_sensors x 2 vector p.
			The jacobian will be automatically calculated as dmeas_func/dx only.
